# Pathfinding Game using OpenGL

This is a pathfinding game developed using OpenGL, a powerful graphics library for creating interactive 2D and 3D graphics. The game focuses on finding the optimal path between two points in a maze-like environment.

## Features

- Pathfinding algorithm: The game implements the A* (A-star) algorithm to find the optimal path from a start point to an end point within the maze.

- Interactive gameplay: Players can navigate through the maze by controlling a character, overcoming obstacles and enemies, and collecting power-ups.

- Visual enhancements: The game utilizes shaders, textures, lighting effects, and particle systems to create visually appealing graphics and immersive gameplay.

- Multiple levels: The game offers multiple levels of increasing difficulty, providing players with varied challenges and mazes to solve.

- User interface: The game includes a user-friendly interface that displays essential information such as the current score, level, and remaining time. It also features buttons for starting a new game, pausing, and accessing settings.

## How to Play

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

   git clone https://github.com/Niyaj-Kumanali/Pathfinding-Game-using-OpenGL.git

2. Launch Code::Blocks and select "Open an existing project" from the main menu.

3. Navigate to the cloned repository directory and open the Code::Blocks project file (.cbp) located in the project root folder.

4. Configure the project's build settings if necessary. Ensure that you have set up the necessary dependencies and libraries for OpenGL development in Code::Blocks.

5. Build the project by selecting "Build" or pressing the corresponding shortcut key (e.g., F9). Code::Blocks will compile the source files and generate the executable.

6. Once the build process completes successfully, you can run the game by selecting "Run" from the menu or pressing the corresponding shortcut key (e.g., F10).

7. Use the arrow keys or WASD keys to control the character's movement within the maze.

8. Find the optimal path from the start point to the end point while avoiding obstacles and enemies.

9. Collect power-ups and complete each level to progress further.
